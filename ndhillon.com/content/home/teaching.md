Over my career I have mentored many developers, however the following courses were formalized:

- Programming: Migrating from PL/1 to C for Software Engineers

- Operating Systems: Introduction of UNIX/Linux operating systems. An exploration of basic commands, utilities, system structures and tools for Stratus VOS engineers.
