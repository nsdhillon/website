# About me

Hi, I am Narinder,<br>
A technology entrepreneur, programmer and researcher.<br>

I am passionate for technology and innovation with more than 25 years of experience in creating leading edge software solutions for the financial and media sector companies such as UBS, NYSE, American Stock Exchange, Boston Stock Exchnage, Bluecrest Captial Management, and Dow Jones.<br>

In 2001, I partnered Market Systems Technology (MST), as a service software consultancy that focused on building and deploying low latency market data systems. We were an early pioneer within the Linux adoption phenomenon as applied to the Captial Markets space. This was demonstated by the deployment of our technology stack on the trading floor Pacific Stock Exchange where we provided both the Market data and the distributed messaging middleware to one if the first Electronic Options trading platform called **PCX Plus**.<br>

In 2009, MST was acquired by [DXC Fixnetix](http://www.fixnetix.com/) which led to the expansion of the Market data platform to include European market centers. <br>

Most recently at DXC Fixnetix I am the technical lead and designer of a high speed, low latency, globally distributed Market data platform. This requires in-depth understanding of the business requirements and how these challenges can be met through rapid and agile development techniques with a focus on organizational goals to effectively link people, processes and technology.

My research interests focus on developing more capable tools to reduce event latency by introducing better software algorithms and techniques to messaging infrastructure.
