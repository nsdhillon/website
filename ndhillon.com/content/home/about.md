# About me

Hi, I am Narinder,<br>
A technology entrepreneur, programmer and researcher.<br>

I am passionate for technology and innovation with more than 25 years of experience in creating leading edge software solutions for the financial and media sector companies that include UBS, NYSE, American Stock Exchange, Boston Stock Exchange, Bluecrest Captial Management, and Dow Jones.<br>

In 2001, I partnered with Market Systems Technology (MST), as a service software consultancy that focused on building and deploying low latency infrastructure systems. We were an early pioneer within the Linux adoption phenomenon as applied to the Capital Markets space. This was demonstrated by the deployment of our technology stack on the trading floor of the Pacific Stock Exchange where we provided both the Market data infrastructure and the distributed messaging middleware to one if the first US electronic options trading platform called **PCX Plus**.<br>

In 2009, due our success in the low latency space MST was acquired by [DXC Fixnetix](http://www.fixnetix.com/). This led to the expansion of the Market data platform to include all European market centers. Both the Market Data platform and the messaging middleware platforms are targeted at customers as alternative to Reuters RDMS and Wombat MAMDA (now Vela) products.<br>

Most recently at DXC Fixnetix I am the technical lead and designer of the high speed, low latency, globally distributed Market data platform. This requires a in-depth understanding of the business requirements and how these challenges can be met through rapid and agile development techniques with a focus on organizational goals to effectively link people, processes and technology.

My research interests focus on developing more capable tools to reduce event latency by introducing better software algorithms and techniques to messaging infrastructures.
